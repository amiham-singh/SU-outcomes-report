# SU-outcomes-report 

Every year since 2010, Syracuse University has been publishing an outcomes report on the employment details of it graduating class.
Since the data is on the website, we know that the university must be keeping a bigger record of this information.  Being a private university SU is except from FIOA.  SO asking for the data directly might not get us what we want.  The data is out there, just not in a format we can analyze. Yet.   
 
For my data acquisition project at Syracuse University, I converted the SU outcomes reports from PDF files to an excel workbook by writing scripts in Python. This repo contains the code and my project report. 
I used PDFTables to convert the reports into CSVS then I wrote Python scripts to clean that data.
